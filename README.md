## Pulls

Pulls is a small cli application name to help you manage pull requests for your repository.
It was created by Michael Crosby to improve the productivity of the [Docker](https://docker.io) maintainers.


Quick installation instructions:

* Install Go 1.2+ from http://golang.org/
* Install with `go get -u github.com/dotcloud/gordon/{pulls,issues}`

* Call `pulls --help` and `issues --help`
* Add your github token with `pulls auth --add <token>`
